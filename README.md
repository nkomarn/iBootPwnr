# iBootPwnr
A Mac app made to help install Android on your iDevice. Since the iDroid project was abandoned some time ago and no one has tried to start it up again, I created this app. I have currently implemented functions for installing OpeniBoot and iDroid, but I plan to add much more later on. If you would like to help out, please tweet me any bugs or suggestions over at @nkomarn on Twitter.

Currently in beta version 0.1
